<p class="normal"><em>Abstract</em>: We present new evidence based on fMRI for the existence and neural architecture of
an abstract supramodal language system that can integrate linguistic inputs arising from different modalities such that
speech and print each activate a common code. Working with sentence material, our aim was to find out where the putative
supramodal system is located and how it responds to comprehension challenges. To probe these questions we examined BOLD
activity in experienced readers while they performed a semantic categorization task with matched written or spoken
sentences that were either well-formed or contained anomalies of syntactic form or pragmatic content. On whole-brain
scans, both anomalies increased net activity over non-anomalous baseline sentences, chiefly at left frontal and temporal
regions of heteromodal cortex. The anomaly sensitive sites correspond approximately to those that previous studies
(Constable et al., 2004, Michael et al., 2001) have found to be sensitive to other differences in sentence complexity
(object relative minus subject relative). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined by peak response to anomaly averaging
over modality conditions. Each anomaly-sensitive ROI showed the same pattern of response across sentence types in each
modality. Voxel-by-voxel exploration over the whole brain based on a cosine similarity measure of common function
confirmed the specificity of supramodal zones.
